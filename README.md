First Page App #SuperConnecter

Superconnecter.link has two components: a mobile app which uses a QR code to contain identifying information, and a website which appears when the QR code is scanned and allows the QR code scanner to swap information.

The mobile app allows the user to create a profile. This includes the user's name, bio, business contact information (including email, address, and website profiles), meeting location, and important details about themselves. The user can also indicate whether they want to use two-way contact sharing (default) or not. This information is attached to a QR code, so information can be shared even if the person scanning it don't have the app.

When the QR code is scanned, the app user's information is immediately added to the contacts of the person scanning it. The person who scanned is then directed to a website where they see the app user's information and are able to send their own information back. Once the exchange occurs, the information of the person scanning is added to the contacts of the app user. In this way, the "business card" of an individual can instantly be shared and swapped.

Watch it live!!
